featuring all the characters, clans, villages, kekkei genkai, tailed
beasts, teams, akatsuki, and rara members from the renowned anime and
manga series *Naruto*. The API provides detailed information on each
character, including their names, appearances, personalities, jutsus,
and ninja tools. This package interfaces with the NarutoDB API through
R.
